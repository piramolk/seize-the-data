    "# About\n",
    "* objectives: Get a clear understanding of the concepts behind A/B testing and apply them on practice data\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is A/B testing?\n",
    "* It is part of user experience research methodology\n",
    "* It involves a randomized experiment wherein two or more versions of a variable (web page, page element etc) are shown to different segments of website visitors at the same time to determine which leaves the maximum impact and drive business metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why A/B testing?\n",
    "* Essentially, A/B testing eliminates all the guesswork out of website optimization and enables experience optimizers to make data-backed decisions. \n",
    "* In A/B testing, A refers to ‘control’ or the original testing variable. Whereas B refers to ‘variation’ or a new version of the original testing variable. \n",
    "* The version that moves your business metric(s) in the positive direction is known as the ‘winner.’ Implementing the changes of this winning variation on your tested page(s) / element(s) can help optimize your website and increase business ROI. \n",
    "* metrics for conversion differ across websites/ uses i.e. sale if products vs generation of leads\n",
    "* A/B testing is one of the components of the overarching process of Conversion Rate Optimisation\n",
    "    * this can be used to gather qualitative and quantitative user insights\n",

    "# Example of task/scenario\n",
    "* You are part of a video game development company, NightFort games\n",
    "* Recently, you have recognized a lot of users quitting after one particular level\n",
    "* The product team has posed a hypothesis <b> that the level is too hard, and making it easier will allow for less user frustration and hence more players continuing to play the game </b>\n",
    "* From this we can extract a few things\n",
    "    * Independent variable (that which we change) : Difficulty of the level\n",
    "    * Dependent variable (that which we monitor) : number of users/ proportion of users continuing to player\n",
    "    * Desired objective: an increase in the number of players continuing to play the game\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Size Calculation\n",
    "### Desired business effect\n",
    ">Our video game company has made some tweaks to the level to make it easier, effectively changing the difficulty from hard to medium. Before blindly rolling an update out to all the users, the product team wants to test the changes on a small sample to see if they make a positive impact.\n",
    "* The desired metric is the <b> percentage of players who continue playing after reaching our level in question </b>. * Currently, <b>70% of users continue to play</b> where the <b>remaining 30% stop playing</b>. \n",
    "* The product team has decided increasing this to <b>75%</b> would warrant deploying the changes and making an update to the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum Detectale Effect\n",
    "* 70 -> 75 : helps us calcualte the minimum detectable effect\n",
    "    * one of the inputs when calculating sample size\n",
    "* as we are comparing two proportions, we will use the `proportion_effectsize` function in statsmodels"
